## Pipeline setup

### Step 1 Clone the repo

[Clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) this repository to your local system.

```
git clone https://github.com/Phil9S/sWGS-absoluteCN.git
cd sWGS-absoluteCN/
```

### Step 2 Install conda

Run the following to install conda whilst following the on-screen instructions.
- When asked to run `conda init` and initialise conda please respond with 'yes'

```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -p $HOME/miniconda/
source ~/.bashrc
rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

See installing [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) for more information.

#### For those with Conda already installed

For systems where conda is already available the following requirements need to be met:
- conda must be available on the PATH
- conda version `4.8.3' or greater
- the location of the installation folder is required

Check the installed version of conda using the following:
```
conda -V
```
*If this command does not work then conda is also not available on the PATH*

Find your installation directory using the following:
```
whereis conda | sed 's%condabin/conda%%'
```

### Step 3 Installing additional dependencies

From within the repository directory, run the `install_env.sh` script to generate a conda environment and install custom packages:

```
install_env.sh $HOME/miniconda/
```

If you used a previously installed conda build please use the conda or miniconda installation directory when running this section instead of '$HOME/miniconda/' to correctly initialise the conda environment.

*To be replaced with a built-in snakemake solution once possible*

The newly installed conda environment can be activated using the following:

```
conda activate swgs-abscn
```

### Step 4 Preparing the input files

#### Sample sheet

The workflow requires a single input file `sample_sheet.tsv` which is a tab-separated document detailing sample names, patient names, smoothing booleans, TP53 allele frequencies, and BAM file locations. Make sure that the BAM file paths are absolute and that sample and patient names are sensible (i.e. do not contain abstract characters or white space). The `TPfreq` column should only contain a float (range 0.00-1.00) or `NA`. The `smooth` column is boolean and should only contain either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

The table below demonstrates the basic schema required and the workflow will validate this file prior to running.

|PATIENT_ID|SAMPLE_ID|TP53freq|smooth|file         |
|----------|---------|--------|------|-------------|
|PAT1      |SAM1     |0.45    |TRUE  |/data/SAM1.bam|
|PAT1      |SAM2     |0.55    |FALSE |/data/SAM2.bam|

An example sample_sheet.tsv is included in this repository.

#### config.yaml

The config.yaml (`config/config.yaml`) contains the necessary information for the pipeline you wish to run. This includes the location of the samplesheet.tsv, bin size, project name, and output directory.

#### profile config.yaml

The profile configs (cluster_config.yaml & config.yaml) (`profile/*/*`) contains the necessary information to configure the job submission parameters passed to a given workload manager (or lack thereof). This includes the number of concurrently sumbitted jobs, account/project name, partition/queue name, and default job resources (though these are low and should work on almost any cluster).

#### Workflow management

This pipeline was primarily developed using the [SLURM][https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html] work load manager for job submission by snakemake. For individuals running on non-workload managed clusters, or utilising other workload managers, profiles are provided to allow for job submission with minimal configuration. Currently supported profiles are `local`, `slurm`, and `pbs`. These can be edited via the script described in the next section.

#### Updating the pipeline configuration

Environment-specific and pipeline-specific parameters need to be set for each run of this pipeline. While it is possible to manually edit the YAML files, a script has been provided to update the most frequently altered parameters programmatically. The script will iteratively list the parameter and its current value, asking for a user submitted new value should it be needed. If the value is already acceptable or does not need to be changed then an empty value (enter return without typing) will keep the current setting.

With the `swgs-abscn` conda environment active, run one of the following code for the profile you wish to update (typically both the pipeline configuration and one cluster configuration):

```
# Pipeline configuration
python update_configs.py -c config
# Slurm configuration
python update_configs.py -c slurm
# PBS-torque configuration
python update_configs.py -c pbs
# Local/non-managed configuration
python update_configs.py -c local
```

## Running the pipeline

### Step 5 Stage 1

Once the pipeline and cluster parameters have been set and the samplesheet is prepared, the first stage of the pipeline is ready to run.

With the `swgs-abscn` conda environment active, run the following:

Confirm the pipeline is configured correctly, run the first stage using the `dry-run` mode.

```
snakemake -n --profile profile/*/ --snakefile stage_1
```

If the previous step ran without error then run the following:

```
snakemake --profile profile/*/ --snakefile stage_1
```

Where * is replaced with the profile matching your cluster/server configuration. 

### Step 6 QC1

At the conclusion of stage 1, files and fits will be generated for all samples present in the `samplesheet.tsv` provided. This will include grid search-generated fits, copy number profile plots, and a `QDNAseq` RDS file containing the copy number fit data. This data is not immediately usable in downstream processes and fits must undergo quality control and fit selection, as samples may generate more than one viable copy number profile.

#### Smoothing

Prior to fit selection, a subset of samples will likely require smoothing of segments in order to be viable. Read the guide provided here to select and update which samples require smoothing [here](resources/smoothing_guide.md). Once the `samplesheet.tsv` has been updated with the new `smooth` values, rerun stage 1 using the following:

```
snakemake --profile profile/*/ -F all --snakefile stage_1
```

Where * is replaced with the profile matching your cluster/server configuration.

#### Fit selection

After running stage 1 with the appropraite smoothing values, copy number fits will have been generated for each sample. In most cases, multiple viable fits will have been selected for each sample and a semi-qualitative quality control process needs to be applied to select the best fitting solution or exclude a sample should no fit be good enough.

Follow the guide on fit selection [here](resources/quality_control_guide.md) to perform quality control and update the `{project}__fit_QC_predownsample.tsv` file. Once this step has been performed and a single acceptable fit has been selected for each sample, proceed to step 7.

### Step 7 Stage 2

Provided quality control and fit selection was performed correctly, stage 2 of the pipeline can be performed which refits all copy number profiles using downsampled BAM files and the selected fits from stage 1.

As before, confirm the pipeline is configured correctly by running with the `dry-run` mode.

```
snakemake -n --profile profile/*/ --snakefile stage_2
```

and if the previous step ran without error then run the following:

```
snakemake --profile profile/*/ --snakefile stage_2
```

Where * is replaced with the profile matching your cluster/server configuration.

### Step 8 QC2

To confirm the quality of newly generated downsampled absolute copy number profiles generated by stage 2, an evalution of outputted fits should be performed as described previously in step 6 [here](resources/quality_control_guide.md). The output `{}` should be updated accordingly, with poor fits being excluded.

### Step 9 Stage 3 - Cohort-level filtering

COMING SOON

This stage has not yet been implemented and performs profile filtering based on step 8 and cohort-level outlier detection to remove specious samples.
